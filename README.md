# FreeWord Dictionary 

## Description
FreeWord Dictionary is an accessible and user‑friendly web application. It allows users to search any word and provides its meaning, definitions, examples, synonyms, and more. The app also includes word pronunciation functionality. When a user searches for a word and clicks the search icon, the app calls the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/), retrieves the data, and displays it on screen. Results include word audio, phonetics, up to three definitions, one example, and synonyms. If a user enters a wrong or misspelled word, the app will display an error message.
